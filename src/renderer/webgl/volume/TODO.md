1. Create/find example that uses plain volume data (similar to ndt_volumes.xml) and plain PNG as TF function that works with Nina's version [done]
- See "tests/scenes/volume_ndt_tf.xhtml". This example renders but unfortunately not correctly yet in the new branch.

2. Make rendering work (XflowVolume)

3. Make plug-ins for TF and BVD work

4. Make PNG slice data work (Xflow.SEQUENCE.ARRAY (Felix?) / Operators: "volumeDataFromPNG")

5. Decouple widgets and make calcTFFromColorTable work

6. Fix tests

7. Prepare volume example

8. Review & Prepare merge
